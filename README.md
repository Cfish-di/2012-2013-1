===========

This is the archive of the projects of my introduction to programming course(in C) on my first university semester.

There are known problems on the first 2 projects(miscellaneous,appart from one on the 2nd project) but
I didn't fix them as I wanted to upload them excactly as they were delivered.

Small explanation of each of the projects.

1:Find the perfect,multiperfect,superperfect numbers(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)
  in the first MAXNUM(defined in the code) numbers.

2:Checks the validity of a password or passwords given from stdin.There are 6 criteria which I won't bother adding 
  as they can be found reading the code.

3:Given a matrix of numbers it finds the path(top to bottom) with the biggest summary in 3 different ways
  Recursively,recursively with an additional board for the summary,iteratively.

4:Implementation of the hex board game(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29)
  Basic AI using minimax with alpha beta prunning.Not too happy with it but it was good compared to the others.
  Fairly easy to use with commands.
